  <h3 class='centerText'>ABOUT ME</h3><br>
I was born in California. In my first years of life, I lived in Mountain View with my parents and my grandma. When I turned four, my little sister was born.
When I got to Kindergarten, we moved to a new house. I love the small town feel of the City where we lived in.  
    <p>   Some activities I enjoy are sports, hanging out with friends, and listening to music. Some sports I like to play are volleyball, swimming, and tennis. My favorite sport is volleyball. Some things my friends and I like to do are talking, playing sports, and playing games we made. Finally, my  two favorite song artists are Billie Eilish and Khalid.  </p>
